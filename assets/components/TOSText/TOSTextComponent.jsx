	      <b>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</b>
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      IDEX provides a secure, convenient service for trading Ethereum based cryptoassets.
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      Step-by-Step Process Explanation:
	      <br />
	      <br />
              </p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>A Registered User can deposit their Ethereum assets into the IDEX contract.</li>
	        <br />
	        <li>Once the deposit has been received, IDEX users can then go to any of the offered markets to trade the cryptoassets.</li>
	        <br />
	        <li>The Registered User is able to perform both maker and taker trades in the various markets. Fees will be taken on the trades at the given rate of the type of trade.</li>
	        <br />
	        <li>When a Registered User wishes to redeem their assets they initiate a withdrawal back to their Ethereum wallet.</li>
	      </ol>
	    </div>
	    <div className="box">
              <p>
	      <b>FEES AND AUTHORIZATION</b>
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      IDEX charges a small transaction fee  on all trades made on the platform. The specific fee charged to the customer is determined by whether the customer is a market maker or market taker. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to IDEX trade fees.
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      IDEX does not charge any fees related to the deposit or withdrawal of cryptoassets. 
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      Users must pay the network gas fee to initiate deposits, withdrawals, and trades (trade gas fee paid by market taker).

              <p>
	      <b>TAXES</b>

	      It is your sole responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. IDEX will make any tax withholdings or filings that we are required by law to make, but IDEX is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.
